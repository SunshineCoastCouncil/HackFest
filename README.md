# SCC HackFest Participant Information

### Welcome

This is the code and content for our HackFest Participant Information website.

We've licenced the code under the GPLv3 and the content under the Creative
Commons Attribution-ShareAlike licence (except any photos and images).

So if you're a school, university or anyone else and would like to use this to
run your own "HackFest" event feel free. That's the reason we've chosen those
licences. If you do we'd love to hear from you. And if you can, keep your version
as a fork on GitHub to make it easier for collaboration. (Just remember to
change the photos and images in your version).


### Branches

We maintain two branches, gh-pages and master. The gh-pages branch we use as
our UAT branch. The master branch is our production branch.

You can view the gh-pages branch in action at 
[https://sunshinecoastcouncil.github.io/HackFest](https://sunshinecoastcouncil.github.io/HackFest) 
and the master branch at [https://scchackfest.azurewebsites.net](https://scchackfest.azurewebsites.net).
