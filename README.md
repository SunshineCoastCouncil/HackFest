# SCC HackFest Participant Information Website

### Welcome

This is the code and content for our HackFest Participant Information website.

We've licenced the code under the GPLv3 and the content under the Creative
Commons Attribution-ShareAlike licence (except any photos and images).

So if you're a school, university, or anyone else, and would like to use this for
your own "HackFest" event go for it. That's the reason we've chosen those
licences. If you do, we'd love to hear from you. And if you can, please keep your
version as a fork on GitHub to make it easier for collaboration. (Just remember
to change the photos and images in your version). Be sure to check out our other
GitHub repositories for code examples and tutorials you can use too.


### Branches

We maintain two branches, gh-pages and master. The gh-pages branch we use as
our UAT branch. The master branch is our production branch.

You can view the gh-pages branch in action at 
[https://sunshinecoastcouncil.github.io/HackFest](https://sunshinecoastcouncil.github.io/HackFest) 
and the master branch at [https://scchackfest.azurewebsites.net](https://scchackfest.azurewebsites.net).
