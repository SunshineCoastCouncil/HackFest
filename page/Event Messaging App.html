    <h1>Event Messaging App</h1>
    <p>To help facilitate communication during the event we have set up the SCC HackFest team in Slack. Slack is a free
        to use team communication tool. As a participant in the event you will be sent an email invitation. If you don't
        receive an invitation please let one of the HackFest helpers know.</p>
    <p>You aren't required to use Slack to participate. But we will be using it throughout the weekend to help keep
        everyone updated on any event schedule changes and things like that.</p>
    <p>It will also provide people who are participating remotely with an easy way to ask for help from our HackFest
        helpers.</p>
