    <h3>I shall follow the competition rules</h3>
    <p>I will only use authorised materials that I have the right to use and release and will not submit any projects which are potentially libelous, false, defamatory or overtly political or contains material which is potentially confidential, commercially sensitive, or which would cause personal distress or loss. I will check the website and/or have a chat with one of the organisers if at any stage I am unclear on the competition rules.</p>
    <h3>I shall look after others and myself</h3>
