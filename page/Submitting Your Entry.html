    <h3>Submitting Your Entry</h3>
    <p>Because of the wide variety of solutions that our participants can come up with we like to be flexible when it
        comes to submitting your entry.</p>
    <p>Some of the ways we accept entries are GitHub, BitBucket, DropBox and OneDrive. If you would like to use
        something else to host your project files please check first. Some services, like YouTube, are not acceptable.</p>
    <p>All entries should be accompanied by a entry summary document, entry video and any related source code,
        schematics, photos, designs, etc.</p>
    <p>The entry summary document should contain the following information...</p>
    <ul>
        <li>name of the entry</li>
        <li>names of everyone who contributed to the entry - for minors a nominated parent/guardian should be listed too</li>
        <li>for teams, the name of person who has been nominated as the team representative (they must be 18+)</li>
        <li>the categories you are entering</li>
        <li>a brief overview of the entry</li>
        <li>a list of urls to any entry content, i.e. github project page, dropbox url, etc</li>
        <li>a brief technical overview of what makes your solution innovative or unique that you can't cover in the entry video</li>
        <li>a list of any open data you used for your entry with urls</li>
        <li>anything that should be disclosed about your entry, i.e. if your entry was partially created prior to the
            HackFest event what was created as part of the event and what was created prior</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Your video should tell a story. It should showcase the problem your solution solves and how it solves it. And
        importantly, it should be no longer than 3 minutes.</p>
