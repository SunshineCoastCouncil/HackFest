    <h1>What can I submit?</h1>
    <p>HackFest is all about taking something and making it better. Using “open data”, data that is officially and freely available for use and reuse, you have to create something clever for one or more of the HackFest categories. </p>
    <p>Entries could include, art, jewellery, a digital sign, a board game, historic film pieces, a virtual reality game, internet of things (IOT), a digital sensor display, a 3D model, a visualisation of data, an informed article and of course some amazing web apps! We only limit you to your imagination.</p>
    <p>Categories and Themes will be nominated from the many ideas that have been submitted as part of the HackFest IdeasFest. </p>
    <p>It’s only 46 hours, so many of concepts entered are prototypes, mock ups, models, smaller scale artworks and even engineering design concepts from our maker community. Of course we have had some very crafty teams deliver live apps within the time frame. Your proof of concepts should be showcased in someway in your 3 minute video submission.</p>
