    <h1>Team Project Storage</h1>
    <p>Once you have formed and registered your team you will be provided with login details for your Team's Project
        Storage space. This is where you will need to save your final entry. The storage space is a Windows share.</p>
    <p>You aren't required to use this space during the weekend for work in progress. But please check you can connect
        to it before you need to submit your entry.</p>
    <p>If you don't know how to map a network drive please refer to the videos below or hit up one of our HackFest helpers on the day.</p>
