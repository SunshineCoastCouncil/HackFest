    <h3>Code Examples, Tutorials and Tools</h3>
    <p>To help you rapidly build a prototype for your awesome idea we have collected some handy code examples and tutorials here.</p>
    <p>
        And if you have any trouble following any of them we will have helpers available throughout the
        event to help.
    </p>

    <h3>Working with ArcGIS</h3>
    <p>
        ArcGIS is a full featured GIS system. But if you haven't used it before it can be quite daunting. We have put
        together a few examples of simple ways you can get, and use, data from it.
    </p>
    <p>
        Two of the ArcGIS services you might be using during the event are
        <a target="_blank" href="http://gisservices.scc.qld.gov.au/arcgis/rest/services">http://gisservices.scc.qld.gov.au/arcgis/rest/services</a> and
        <a target="_blank" href="http://cloud.locate.scc.qld.gov.au/arcgis/rest/services">http://cloud.locate.scc.qld.gov.au/arcgis/rest/services</a>

    <h3>Working with GeoJSON</h3>
    <p>
        GeoJSON is becoming a very popular format for working with geospatial information. To make it easier for you to
        create your own data mash ups you can convert GeoJSON to CSV for editing in Excel.
    </p>
    <p>
        Check out <a target="_blank" href="http://convertcsv.com/">convertcsv.com</a> to
        <a target="_blank" href="http://convertcsv.com/geojson-to-csv.htm">convert GeoJSON to CSV</a> or
        <a target="_blank" href="http://convertcsv.com/csv-to-geojson.htm">convert CSV back to GeoJSON</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Displaying a Map</h3>
    <p>
        Leaflet is an open-source, lightweight javascript library for creating interactive,
        mobile friendly maps. They also have some great code examples to get you going quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
        Check out the <a target="_blank" href="http://leafletjs.com/examples.html">Leaflet Tutorials</a>,
        especially the <a target="_blank" href="http://leafletjs.com/examples/geojson/">Using GeoJSON with Leaflet tutorial</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are trying to use ArcGIS services with Leaflet be sure to check out
        <a target="_blank" href="http://esri.github.io/esri-leaflet/">Esri Leaflet</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        If Leaflet is too much outside your comfort zone you can even build a quick proof of concept
        with Excel.

    <h3>Example Prototype</h3>
    <p>
        One of the ideas that came out of HackFest 2015 was Dogs Unleashed. An app that would tell you where you could
        exercise your dog, off leash, combined with other information like dog watering bowls and beach access points.
    </p>
    <p>
        There is a basic example implementation of the
        <a target="_blank" href="https://patros.github.io/DogsUnleashed/">Dogs Unleashed</a> idea. It still needs some work. But it
        demonstrates a number of key bits of functionality, including displaying multiple SCC GIS layers on a map. You
        can view the code on the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/patros/DogsUnleashed">Dogs Unleashed GitHub page</a>. The
        licence is open, so feel free to use it as a starting point for your entry.
