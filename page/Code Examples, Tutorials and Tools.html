    <h1>Code Examples, Tutorials and Tools</h1>
    <p>To help you rapidly build a prototype for your awesome idea we have collected some handy code examples and tutorials here.</p>
    <p>
        And if you have any trouble following any of them we will have helpers available throughout the
        event to help.

    <h3>Working with ArcGIS</h3>
    <p>
        ArcGIS is a full featured GIS system. But if you haven't used it before it can be quite daunting. We have put
        together a few examples of simple ways you can get, and use, data from it.
    </p>
    <p>
        Two of the ArcGIS services you might be using during the event are
        <a href="http://gisservices.scc.qld.gov.au/arcgis/rest/services">http://gisservices.scc.qld.gov.au/arcgis/rest/services</a> and
        <a href="http://cloud.locate.scc.qld.gov.au/arcgis/rest/services">http://cloud.locate.scc.qld.gov.au/arcgis/rest/services</a>

    <h3>Working with GeoJSON</h3>
    <p>
        GeoJSON is becoming a very popular format for working with geospatial information. To make it easier for you to
        create your own data mash ups you can convert GeoJSON to CSV for editing in Excel.
    </p>
    <p>
        Check out <a href="http://convertcsv.com/">convertcsv.com</a> to
        <a href="http://convertcsv.com/geojson-to-csv.htm">convert GeoJSON to CSV</a> or
        <a href="http://convertcsv.com/csv-to-geojson.htm">convert CSV back to GeoJSON</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Displaying a Map</h3>
    <p>
        Leaflet is an open-source, lightweight javascript library for creating interactive,
        mobile friendly maps. They also have some great code examples to get you going quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
        Check out the <a href="http://leafletjs.com/examples.html">Leaflet Tutorials</a>,
        especially the <a href="http://leafletjs.com/examples/geojson/">Using GeoJSON with Leaflet tutorial</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        If Leaflet is too much outside your comfort zone you can even build a quick proof of concept
        with Excel.
